Examples of configuring logging for an app, or not, when using libraries that
use python's built in logging framework.

nologging 
    shows what happens when you use a library that uses logging at various levels
importonly
    shows when logging is imported, but never used or configured. (a single
warning is squelchable)

simplelogging
    logging is imported, and used directly via the class methods, ala "A
simple example" on http://docs.python.org/howto/logging.html

on_by_default and off_by_default
    using explict configuration of logging to set the default level, and then
two different config methods, depending on whether you prefer libraries to
only be seen if asked for, or seen until asked to be quiet
